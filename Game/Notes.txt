Notes about what I want to add to the Game...

1. Need to create a base.  Base will need defenses that can be upgraded.

2. Base will have a chest to hold supplies.

3. Base can be raided by enemies.

4. Character will need to store a distance from base. to show how far they have traveled. They will need to go back to base to get supplies.

5. Character needs a way to carry supplies. A knapsack maybe.

6. Character needs a damage deflection. That way the effect of a hit will be less for a heavy character than it would be for a smaller character. Similar characters would not use this damage deflection property.

7.  Need to think of different kinds of characters and add classes for them.

8. Need to think of different kinds of weapons and which characters can use those weapons.

9.  Have a magician character.  This character will be able to assist other characters as long as they are close to the magician.
