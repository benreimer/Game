Notes about what I want to add to the Game...

1. Need to create a base.  Base will need defenses that can be upgraded.

2. Base will have a chest to hold supplies.

3. Base can be raided by enemies.

4. Character will need to store a distance from base. to show how far they have traveled. They will need to go back to base to get supplies.

5. Character needs a way to carry supplies. A knapsack maybe.

6. Character needs a damage deflection. That way the effect of a hit will be less for a heavy character than it would be for a smaller character. Similar characters would not use this damage deflection property.

7.  Need to think of different kinds of characters and add classes for them.

8. Need to think of different kinds of weapons and which characters can use those weapons.

9.  Have a magician character.  This character will be able to assist other characters as long as they are close to the magician.

10. Create a mercenary character.  These will show up on the map from time to time and can be hired to help you out.  They will have usually be in favor of one sect or another so watch out, they might turn on you.

11. Game will need coins.  The will use these to buy supplies at a shop or pay for mercenaries to help them out.

12. Will need to create a shop that will allow the user to shop for supplies such as food, armor or weapons.

13. Need to think about how to handle levels. 

14. Need to think about how to build Maps - what elements will these have?
